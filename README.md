## PacMen Exercise

### Description:
This is a project that I edited for MIT xPRO's web development class. The goal was to add edge detection so that the PacMan turns around when it runs into the edge of the screen. 

Most of the code was provided for me by MIT xPRO. 

I primarily edited the "checkPageBounds" function in order to accomplish this goal. 

#### How to Run: 

Open the index.html file in a browser, and the PacMan should move back and forth across the screen (changing direction at the boundaries) and chomping as it switches between open and closed mouth images. 

#### Support:

N/A

#### Roadmap of Future Improvements: 
It might be nice to add little dots for the PacMan to eat as it chomps across the screen.
